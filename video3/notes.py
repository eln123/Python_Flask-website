# in video 3, we learn about "inheritance"
# it allows you to create a base template
# that all our other templates can work off of

# also, we learn about bootstrap to make our website look good
# this is one of the few front end and styling videos

# "template inheritance"
# use basically everything from an inherited html page, maybe change small things
# it's like having nested React components

# notice app.run(debug=True)
# this makes it so if you make changes, you don't have to run the file again, just refresh
