# in video 3, we learn about "inheritance"
# it allows you to create a base template
# that all our other templates can work off of

# also, we learn about bootstrap to make our website look good
# this is one of the few front end and styling videos

# "template inheritance"
# use basically everything from an inherited html page, maybe change small things
# it's like having nested React components

# notice app.run(debug=True)
# this makes it so if you make changes, you don't have to run the file again, just refresh

# bootstrap
    # bootstrap is basically a CSS framework for styling your website
    # link: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/
    # copy and paste the CSS link there into your head tag in your base.html:
        # <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.3.1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T" crossorigin="anonymous">

    # copy and paste script tags for Javascript, you need those for their components to function
        # ^ copy and paste script tags at bottom of body
    # this is on a cdn, which basically means it grabs the CSS code and Javascript code from the internet, so we don't need to run any files
