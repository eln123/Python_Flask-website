# video 5 is about sessions
# how we can do the previous video's code better

# a session is something you use while user is on website, then when you leave it disappears
# ex: a user logs in, a new session is created
# as they go through pages, they have the session data
# with the user's info and other info
# as soon as the user leaves, all the session data is gone
# when they login back in, the session data reloads
# sessions are temporary, stored on the server, not the client side
# they are designed as a quick way to access information and to pass things around our server

# import session from flask
